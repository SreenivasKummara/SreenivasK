# INTRODUCTION

At present since Apr. 2017, I am working as an institute postdoctoral fellow at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT B), India. I graduated Ph.D. in the period of Oct. 2012 to Mar. 2016 from Toyota Technological Institute (TTI), Nagoya under the supervision of Prof. Kohji Tashiro on the topic of  “Isotope Effect on the Isothermal Crystallization of Polyoxymethylene”. Before Ph.D., I worked as a project assistant at CSIR- National Chemical Laboratory in Dr. Guruswamy Kumaraswamy group in the period from Jan 2009 to Sep 2012. I graduated M.Sc. in Polymer Science from Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh in 2008.
