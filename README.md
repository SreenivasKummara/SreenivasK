# INTRODUCTION

At present since Apr. 2017, I am working as an institute postdoctoral fellow at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT B), India. I graduated Ph.D. in the period of Oct. 2012 to Mar. 2016 from Toyota Technological Institute (TTI), Nagoya under the supervision of Prof. Kohji Tashiro on the topic of  “Isotope Effect on the Isothermal Crystallization of Polyoxymethylene”. Before Ph.D., I worked as a project assistant at CSIR- National Chemical Laboratory in Dr. Guruswamy Kumaraswamy group in the period from Jan 2009 to Sep 2012. I graduated M.Sc. in Polymer Science from Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh in 2008.

# RESEARCH INTEREST

	Micro-structural evolution process during the melt and solvent induced crystallization process. 
	Structure – morphology – property of semicrystalline polymers and polymer/ inorganic hybrid-materials and composites.
	Flow induced crystallization. 
	Block copolymers and their self-assembly. 

# PROFESSIONAL SKILLS

	Skilled in cationic ring opening polymerization and functional end group transformation reaction of polyoxymethylene Deuterated / Hydrogenated random copolymers. 

	Skilled in usage of Small Angle X-ray Scattering (X-ray diffractro meter Nanoviewer (Rigaku) and  Bruker Nanostar), Wide Angle X-ray diffraction (2D) , powder X-ray diffraction (TTR),  vibrational spectroscopy FTIR (including Kinetics), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), rheology,  especially in-situ measurements of crystallization behavior using simultaneous measurements of SAXS/WAXD/FTIR and  synchrotron X-ray measurements.

	Shear induced crystallization and morphological change of semicrystalline polymers and gelation process measurements by using in-situ X-ray and rheological techniques.
